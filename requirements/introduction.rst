Introduction
============

ASGARD Management Center is our central management platform for
`THOR <https://thor-manual.nextron-systems.com/en/latest/>`_ scans,
`Aurora <https://aurora-agent-manual.nextron-systems.com/en/latest/>`_
for real time protection of your endpoints, custom playbooks,
or even Thunderstorm. It can manage distributed THOR scans on
thousands of systems, collecting and forwarding the scan results to our
`ASGARD Analysis Cockpit <https://analysis-cockpit-manual.nextron-systems.com/en/latest/>`_
or your own SIEM.

The ASGARD Management Center can control and execute complex response tasks
if needed, opening live remote command prompts on your endpoints, or executing
other actions incident response specialists will find useful. Additionally,
it provides an easy to use interface for creating custom multi-step response
playbooks, which can execute any command on your endpoints and collect the respective outputs.

The ASGARD Management Center comes bundled with Debian on a custom ISO file
and can be deployed in many different ways.

This document describes all functions and steps for the setup and operation of
the ASGARD Management Center. It will describe how to add systems for scanning
and performing individual or group scanning with separate parameters.
