Introduction
============

ASGARD Management Center is the central management platform for THOR scans.
It manages distributed THOR scans on thousands of systems, collects and
forwards scan results. 

The ASGARD Management Center can control and execute complex response tasks
if needed. It features built-in response playbooks for quarantining endpoints
creating and collecting triage packs, opening live remote command prompts and
other actions incident response specialists will find useful. 

ASGARD additionally provides an easy to use interface for creating custom
multi-step response playbooks, which can execute any command on your endpoints
and collect the respective outputs.

ASGARD Management Center is available as a virtual appliance and also as a
hardware appliance. Both are based on Debian Bullseye and require a setup procedure
in order to generate customized agent installers and cryptographic keys. 

This document describes all functions and steps for the setup and operation of
the ASGARD Management Center. It will describe how to add systems for scanning
and performing individual or group scanning with separate parameters.
