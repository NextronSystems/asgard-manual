Advanced Settings
=================

The Advanced tab lets you specify additional global settings.
The session timeout for web-based UI can be configured. Default
is one hour. If ``Show Advanced Tasks`` is set, ASGARD will
show system maintenance jobs (e.g. update ASGARD Agent on endpoints)
within the response control section. 

Inactive assets can be hidden in the Asset Management Section
by setting a suitable threshold for ``Hide inactive Assets``.
