.. index:: User Management

User Management
===============

Access user management via ``Settings`` > ``Users``. This section
allows administrators to add or edit user accounts.

The field ``2FA`` in the overview indicates if a
user has ``Two Factor Authentication`` enabled or not.

   Add User Account

Editing a user account does not require a password although
the fields are shown in the dialogue. An initial password
has to be provided for user creation, though.

Access the user roles in ``Settings`` > ``Roles``. 

You can download a list of all users in CSV format.

Roles
^^^^^

By default, ASGARD ships with the following pre-configured
user roles. The pre-configured roles can be modified or
deleted. The ASGARD role model is fully configurable.

Note that all users except users with the right ``Readonly`` have the right to run scans on endpoints. 

The following section describes these predefined rights and restrictions that each role can have.

LDAP Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to configure LDAP, navigate to ``Settings`` > ``LDAP``.
In the left column you can test and configure the LDAP connection itself.
In the right column, the mapping of LDAP groups to ASGARD groups
(and its associated permissions) is defined.

First check if your LDAP server is reachable by ASGARD by clicking "Test Connection".

Then check the bind user you want to use for ASGARD. Read
permissions on the bind user are sufficient. To find out
the distinguished name you can use an LDAP browser or query
using the PowerShell AD module command ``Get-ADUser <username>``.

Next configure the LDAP filters used to identify the groups and
users and their preferred attributes in your LDAP structure.
A default for LDAP and AD in a flat structure is given in the
**"Use recommended filters"** drop-down menu, but you can
adapt it to your liking. The test button shows you if a login
with that user would be successful and which groups ASGARD identified
and could be used for a mapping to ASGARD groups.

If you need to adapt the recommended configuration or want to customize it,
we recommend an LDAP browser such as `ADExplorer <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer>`_
from Sysinternals to browse your LDAP structure. As an example you could
use your organization's e-mail address as a user login name if you change the "User Filter"
to ``(&(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=user)(userPrincipalName=%s))``

.. note::
   You need to save the configuration by clicking ``Update LDAP Config``.
   Using the test buttons only uses the data in the forms, but does not
   save it, so that you can use it for testing purposes anytime,
   without changing your working configuration.

After the LDAP configuration is set up, you need to provide role mapping from LDAP groups to ASGARD groups.
This is done in the right column by using the ``Add LDAP Role`` feature.
