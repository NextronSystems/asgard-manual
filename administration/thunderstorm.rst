Thunderstorm
------------

Since version 3.1 of the ASGARD Management Center, you can
install THOR Thunderstorm directly on your ASGARD system.
This allows you to scan your endpoints - which cannot run
THOR - with THOR Thunderstorm.

You need a valid license issued to the hostname of the ASGARD
Management Center to use THOR Thunderstorm.
