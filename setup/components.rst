   :alt: landing page of the nextronInstaller

Enter your Installation Code and click next. Follow
the instructions on the screen and finish the installation.
You will need to upload your license file for the ASGARD
Management Center to continue. The Installer will also
try to connect to our update server, as this is needed
to download any packages necessary for your ASGARD Management
Center to be installed. Make sure you can reach the update
servers (see :ref:`requirements/network:internet access during installation`).

After the installation is completed, you will be instructed
on how to navigate to the landing page of your ASGARD
Management Center.
