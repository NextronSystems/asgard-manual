Master ASGARD
=============

The Master ASGARD is a single central management console that can control
all of your ASGARD systems. It is meant to centrally manage controlled
scans on all your ASGARD systems. MASTER ASGARD also provides one central
point of management for your Response Playbooks, Evidence Collection
and IOC Management. A special license for this is needed.

.. note::
    Please note that the Master ASGARD is a completely separate system from
    your existing Management Center. This means a new server/vm and a special
    license are required.
