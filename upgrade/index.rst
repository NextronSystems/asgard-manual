Upgrade from Management Center v2 to v3
=======================================

This Chapter contains instructions on how to upgrade your running
Management Center version 2.17.1 to the newest version 3.

We developed an update program which helps you through the upgrade
by automating the process as much as possible.

    If you are using the ``Broker Network`` functionality, please
    consider updating the components as well. You can find the
    instructions in the ``Broker Network Manual`` in the section
